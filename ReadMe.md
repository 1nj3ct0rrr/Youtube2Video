# Youtube2Text 📹

Using this project, you can download the said texts from Youtube videos 🙂🙃

This notebook uses an [open source project](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech) to transcribe a given Youtube video 🤩

To show an example for this project, we used one of [Mr.Beast videos](https://youtu.be/e5nlD2LfGd0), which had a good result 😁

Steps to follow to see the result of this project:
  1. Download the video 📹
  2. Convert to a WAV file 🛠️
  3. Do Speech recognition 🙂🙃

The video below is the same as the test video 👇
